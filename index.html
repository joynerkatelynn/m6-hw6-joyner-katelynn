                    Katelynn Joyner is a first-year graduate student studying political communications at the University of Florida. A Double Gator in progress, Katelynn received her bachelor's 
                    degree in public relations with a minor in music performance in April 2022 from UF. Throughout her time as an undergraduate student, she served as a member of the University
                    of Florida Gator Marching Band, the 2019 Preview Staff, and with the Florida Cicerones. She discovered her passion for communications early on in college. Katelynn sees the "why?"
                    behind people's stories and is passionate about making change within her community. Some of Katelynn's main policy interest areas include public education, accessible health care,
                    and mental health.
                    Katelynn began her political career in 2017 by serving as a Messenger with the Florida House of Representatives Page and Messenger program. She was a founding member of her
                    high school's chapter of March for Our Lives before she graduated in 2018. Once arriving to UF, she became an active member of the Change Party in student government. Katelynn
                    was a communications fellow for Florida Representative Omari Hardy in Spring 2021 and was a campaign intern for his Congressional campaign in the fall. This past summer, she 
                    completed a dual internship with Florida House, a non-profit, non-partisan organization, and the United States House of Representatives, where she was a policy intern for 
                    Representative Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick. After returning from DC, Katelynn served as a campaign intern for Florida Representative Anna V. Eskamani and helped execute a successful
                    re-election campaign in the Fall 2022 cycle. Currently, Katelynn is putting her passion for education to use by interning with UF's College of the Arts.
                    Outside of politics, Katelynn is a self-proclaimed nerd. She enjoys spending her free time by watching movies and playing Dungeons and Dragons with her friends. Some of her hobbies
                    include photography, traveling, and making Spotify playlists. Katelynn currently resides in Gainesville with her roommates and their cat, Autumn.
